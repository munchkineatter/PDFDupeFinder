Plan Your Project

Decide on the main features: file scanning, duplicate detection, merging, and deleting
Choose a programming language (Python recommended)
Select a GUI framework (PyQt or PySide suggested)


Set Up Your Development Environment

Install Python and necessary libraries
Set up a code editor or IDE of your choice


Design the User Interface

Sketch out a dark-themed, modern GUI layout
Include elements like:

A button to select folders
A scan button
A view to display results
Buttons for merging and deleting duplicates
A progress bar




Implement File Scanning

Create a function to browse and select folders
Develop a method to scan for PDF files in the selected folder and subfolders
Display scanning progress to the user


Develop Duplicate Detection

Implement a way to calculate a unique identifier (hash) for each PDF
Group files with matching identifiers
Show groups of duplicates in the results view


Create PDF Comparison Functionality

Develop a method to compare PDFs page by page
Design a way to display comparison results to the user


Add Merge Functionality

Implement a feature to combine selected duplicate PDFs
Allow users to choose where to save the merged file
Update the file list after merging


Implement Delete Functionality

Add a feature to safely delete selected duplicates (move to recycle bin)
Update the file list after deletion


Refine the User Interface

Implement the dark theme consistently across all windows
Ensure all buttons and features are easily accessible
Add tooltips or help text for clarity


Optimize Performance

Implement multi-threading for faster scanning and processing
Optimize memory usage, especially for large PDF files


Handle Errors and Edge Cases

Add error messages for common issues (file access, corrupt PDFs)
Implement safeguards against accidental deletions


Test Thoroughly

Check all features with various file sizes and folder structures
Test on different operating systems if possible
Fix any bugs or issues discovered


Add Final Touches

Include a help section or user guide
Add any additional settings or customization options
Polish the overall look and feel of the application


Prepare for Distribution

Create an installer or package for easy distribution
Write clear installation and usage instructions
